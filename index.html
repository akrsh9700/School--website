Each of us, sooner or later, goes through a moment or a situation when it seems that we are on the wrong road, and life is moving in the wrong direction. But this is also true that some things are within our control and what disturbs us are not events or situations, but our attitude towards them.<br><br>
"Your attitude is either the lock on or key to your door to success" Denis Waitley<br><br>
Dear all, I wish you the blessing of a positive attitude, and this is what we also try to build in our students. We, at <span class="highlight-tlws">THE LEARNING WORLD SCHOOL</span>, strive to provide a platform where a child is holistically educated, encompassing physical (physiological), mental (cognitive), social, emotional (psychological) and spiritual (oriented towards the almighty) growth.<br><br>
We aim that our students became a resource for tomorrow. We accentuate learning by synergy and collaboration and this surely comes with a positive attitude towards life. Every student at Learning World family is given a voice and avenue where they are able to express their knowledge and dream big and achieve bigger.<br><br>
As water reflects the face, so one's life reflects the heart. (Proverbs 27:19)<br><br>
I am confident that at the <span class="highlight-tlws">The Learning World School</span>, everyone will understand the true meaning of life, love life and live life to its fullest with the Almighty as the guide, and reach the heights of glory.<br><br>
May the Almighty Lord, continue to protect and bless our school.<br><br>
We innovate to change Accept, Adopt, Adapt to achieve, fear not take a step and cross the chasm.<br><br>
I feel immense joy in informing that we pioneered in introducing the basketball PP tiles for providing best training facilities to our beloved students to develop their kinematic skills.<br><br>
In expecting excellence, we ensured that children enjoy learning and enhance their skills and therefore established AI classes to provide the higher quality education.<br><br>
The whole purpose of education is to turn mirrors into windows.<br><br>
We sincerely hope and wish to create a landmark in this direction by developing life skills through real education. Let us continue to strive for greatness, knowing that with perseverance, passion and God's blessings we can achieve anything.<br><br>
Warm regards and blessing from the almighty.</p>

                <p>Dear Parents, students and well-wishers of the Learning World  family- my prayerful greetings to all of you. First and foremost I would like to express my deep sentiments of gratitude to every one of you for your constant support, love and concern towards the school which enables and encourages us to strive hard to carry forward the mission of spreading value- based knowledge to one and all.<br><br>
Education is not an act of acquiring knowledge but learning a skill to lead life and forming one's personality. This is an ennobling process of growth. I can boldly say that we have excelled in every initiative that we undertook and we have stood together in facing the challenges in realizing quality education. We focus on discovering, developing and drawing out the hidden talents and the magic lying dormant inside all of its students. From academics to co-curricular activities, perseverance and a never-say-die spirit are entrenched in the heart of every student not only making them good students but brilliant human beings. In today's dynamic world, a 360 degree development and grooming is of supreme importance and through our campus we are creating an environment for future leaders, entrepreneurs and professional who possess skills and aptitudes in an array of functional disciplines.<br><br>
I am very happy with the progress the school has made by imbibing in its students value based education synergized with modern teaching-learning methods to produce a generation of well informed and emotionally sound generation. I am positive that in times to come we will continue this journey with elevated enthusiasm and persistently provide a platform of holistic learning to the young generation of learners.<br><br>
We are partners in learning with our students and seek to deepen their knowledge, provide enriching innovative learning experiences, while also gently urging our students to come out of their comfort zone to attempt new challenges.<br><br>
Our students graduate with the skills, mind sets and qualities that will best equip them for success Come on let's give our best and make this institution a modern temple of learning through our diligence, devotion and dedication. Wishing you all the best... in the world of the future. They are the future leaders and role models of society.</p>
